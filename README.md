* When was the company incorporated?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Valora App officially launched in February 2021, led by CEO, Jackie Bona. It allows its users to send payments with Celo dollar stablecoins (cUSD) and cGLD, the Celo cryptocurrency. 

* Who are the founders of the company?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rene Reinsberg, Sep Kamvar, and Marek Olszewski co-founded the CELO framework and blockchain from which Valora operates. Jackie Bona, one of Valora's initial investors, has now assumed CEO of the company after leading the founding team that developed the payment app. The Valora app now operates as its own independant company running on the CELO network. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for the Valora payment app was inspired by the notion that people should be able to govern their own money, be able to send, receive and pay for services instantly and without having to deal with intermediaries. It started as a crypto wallet, but has evolved to become the next Venmo for crypto. When they created the CELO network  a financial system that provided its users with financial freedom. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company raised a whopping 20 million dollars with their first roung of venture capital financing through selling their CELO stock. They decided to use the funds for product development and educational content that helps users become more accustomed to using cryptocurrencies. Many of the original backers of CELO went on to contribute capitol that funded the Valora project.  

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CELO network is run and operated by using the CELO cryptocurrency to vote on network upgrades. People can send the networks currency to send, receive, and stake it. Their goal is to educate and encourage people to become comfortable using cryptocurrencies to send money, pay for services, send remmittances, etc. Valora strives to make it easy for anyone who has access to a smartphone to have full control over their finances and be able make payments quickly without the overhead costs of commission or exchange fees. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target market for Valora is basically anyone with a smartphone that is also interested in storing, using, and sending cryptocurrency to others with quick and painless transactions. Those who wish to send remmittance payments to family and friends in other countries. Those who are new to cryptocurrency and wish to learn more about how they can be used to make life simpler. Valora spent much of its initial investment towards educational purposes to expose the simplicity and ease that crypto can bring to the every day person. As of July, 27, 2021 it was reported there were over 200k users with a balance on Valora. There are over 53,000 active monthly users across 100 countries worldwide that use Valora as a way to make payments, send, and save. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all the qualities that deem this app evolutionary - is the app's usability. Most crypto wallets and exchanges can be pretty complicated and confusing for a first time crypto user. Those who aren't already tech savvy can be discouraged by the high learning curve, leaving millions of users behind who don't have the technical knowledge to navigate the process. Upon first login of the Valor app, its platform is a familiar one. The apps layout is almost a mirror image to that of Venmo or paypal. For anyone who has used online banking or sent money to friends using a cashapp, the home page is a welcome sight - no pun intended. Enjoy earning 5% interest on your crypto or cash out with ease.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLabs ("Celo Labs") - a Teal organization that builds financial technology - began work on Celo in 2017, an open source ecosystem of technologies, organizations and inndividuals. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celo is a layer 1 protocol and blockchain platform that originated as a fork of Ethereum Go (geth), but is completely separate from the Ethereum network and uses a proof-of-stake concensus mechanism. While Celo and Ethereum both use Ethereum Virtual Machine to support the use of smart contracts, the cryptoassets on Celo are not ERC-20 tokens. However, the code that supports ERC-20 tokens can be adapted to be compatible with Celo assets. This means that developers can use and write smart contracts that have already been developed for Ethereum. Writing and managing a set of smart contracts with Solidity and Truffle, then running them on the secure and decentralized Celo blockchain, comprises the Celo Protocol.
