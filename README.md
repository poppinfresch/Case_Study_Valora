## Introducing Valora
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Valora App officially launched in February 2021, led by CEO, Jackie Bona. It allows its users to send payments with Celo dollar stablecoins (cUSD) and cGLD, the Celo network's native cryptocurrency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rene Reinsberg, Sep Kamvar, and Marek Olszewski co-founded the Celo framework and blockchain from which Valora operates. Jackie Bona, one of Valora's initial investors, has now assumed CEO of the company after leading the founding team that developed the payment app. The Valora app now operates as its own independent company running on the Celo network.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea for the Valora payment app was inspired by the notion that people should be able to govern their own money, be able to send, receive and pay for services instantly and without having to deal with intermediaries. It started as a crypto wallet but has evolved to become the next Venmo for crypto. The mission behind the Celo network was to build a financial system that provides its users with financial freedom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valora raised a whopping 20 million dollars with its first round of venture capital financing by selling its native coin. They decided to use the funds for product development and educational content that helps users become more accustomed to using cryptocurrencies. Many of the original backers of Celo went on to contribute capital that funded the Valora project.

## Business Activities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Celo network is run and operated by using the Celo cryptocurrency to vote on network upgrades. People can use the network's currency to send, receive, and stake it. Their goal is to educate and encourage people to become comfortable using cryptocurrencies to send money, pay for services, send remittances, etc. Valora strives to make it easy for anyone who has access to a smartphone to have full control over their finances and be able to make payments quickly without the overhead costs of commission or exchange fees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As of July 27, 2021, it was reported there were over 200k users with a balance on Valora. There are over 53,000 active monthly users across 100 countries worldwide that use Valora as a way to make payments, send, and save.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all the qualities Valora holds is the app's usability. Most crypto wallets and exchanges can be pretty complicated and confusing for a first-time crypto user. Those who aren't already tech-savvy can be discouraged by the high learning curve, leaving millions of users behind who don't have the technical knowledge to navigate the process. Upon the first login of the Valor app, its platform is a familiar one. The app's layout is almost a mirror image to that of Venmo or PayPal. For anyone who has used online banking or sent money to friends using a cash app, the home page is a welcome sight - no pun intended. Enjoy earning 5% interest on your crypto or cash out with ease.

## Technology
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLabs ("Celo Labs") - a Teal organization that builds financial technology - began work on Celo in 2017, an open-source ecosystem of technologies, organizations, and individuals.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celo is a layer 1 protocol and blockchain platform that originated as a fork of Ethereum Go (geth), but is completely separate from the Ethereum network and uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Contrary to the energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism, Celo's proof-of-stake maximizes efficiency and reduces fees. Validators stake their crypto and are rewarded proportionally to the amount of crypto they stake.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Celo and Ethereum both use Ethereum Virtual Machine to support the use of smart contracts, the crypto assets on Celo are not ERC-20 tokens. However, the code that supports ERC-20 tokens can be adapted to be compatible with Celo assets. This means that developers can use and write smart contracts that have already been developed for Ethereum. Writing and managing a set of smart contracts with Solidity and Truffle, then running them on the secure and decentralized Celo blockchain, comprises the Celo Protocol. The Celo currency is used by Celo holders to vote on network upgrades, each vote is weighted by the amount of Celo they hold. Transactions on the network are validated and the transaction fee ($.001) pays for the validators who work to secure the network and validate each transaction.

## Landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valora falls under the domain of mobile dapps, using blockchain, cryptocurrencies to make payments and remittances. Many companies have partnered with Celo to use it as a mainstay for paying their employees and service providers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venmo, Coinbase Wallet, Voyager, Metamask, are all similar platforms that serve as exchanges, wallets, or cash apps. While they all differ in what they specialize in, they are always competing for market share. Venmo only recently added crypto to their platform after they realized the shift towards decentralized finance. Now you can buy BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH on Venmo & then send it to your friends. When one app in the mobile crypto domain releases a new feature that threatens the survival of the others, evolution occurs. Valora will need to adapt to the evolving market to compete with Venmo's features. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day Venmo launched crypto on Venmo, 30% of Venmo's 70 million users used the new feature. In the 20 years PayPal has been around, it has cultivated over 375 million users. Valora seems to be holding its own with a current 200k total users and 53k active monthly users in just 5 months since the platform launched. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valora uses the cGLD coin as the infrastructure for its platform. Upon launch, the price of cGLD hovered around $2.85 per coin, over the next few months it saw the highest high of its lifetime, topping at $7.30 per coin. With a supply of 287 coins and a market cap of 783.3 million, cGLD holds the #11 spot on Coinbase's popularity list, right behind COMP Wallet. Celo has held strong against its competitors and seems to have earned its spot in the race for the long run.

## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies have adopted the Celo Blockchain as a ledger for their company's payroll. Non-profits have allied with Celo to bring financial tools to refugees. Celo is backed by venture funds, academics, an array of experts, and formed alliances with more than 130 organizations all over the world to work towards shared goals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With so many innovations in blockchain & uses for crypto, it is hard to believe the industry is only in its infancy. Over 50% of the world has access to or owns a smartphone. With cryptocurrency introduction a little over a decade ago, 70 million of those smartphone users have a blockchain wallet of some kind - and 200k of them chose Valora.

## Recommendations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Valora is a great option for people new to crypto, it doesn't currently support the use of Bitcoin, Etherium, or alt-coins like Dogecoin. A wallet provides useful for anyone holding crypto for the short and long term. People want to be able to put their investments to use. If they can't deposit other cryptocurrencies they hold into Valora, they will need a separate wallet for those coins. Imagine having a different wallet for each credit card, and another for your cash. It isn't practical. If Valora adopted the use of top-performing cryptos, it would bring exponential value to the platform and the currencies it adopts. Coin adoption across platforms brings a larger audience and helps the value of the coin grow. The more use cases for Valora, the more valuable cGLD becomes. People will come to Valora to send Dogecoin to friends but will stay for ease of use and the value Valora brings them.
